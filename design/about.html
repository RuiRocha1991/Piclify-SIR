				<p>In the curricular unit of Network Information Systems we were offered a work to share files. However we chose to share photos, flickr style.
					Users can place photos, create albums, create groups, follow other users, and join groups created by other users. They can also interact with the other users, being able to comment and react the photos shared by the users.
					It obeys a mvc architecture, with the realization of the project we wanted to learn as much about php and node technologies, we chose to join the two languages. We used the node to perform the controller part and php to perform the model part, with the perfect notion that we could undo one of them and have the same result. As a system of data persistence we use mysql, a still widely used database system that we find important to explore as well.
					The project uses a system of tokens that are generated on the node with the "jsonwebtoken" framework, a "fluent-validators" validation library is used, the entire node part is followed by a playlist available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQCmSnNFVYnTFo60Bt972f8HA4Td7WKwq">here</a>.</p>
					<p>For academic purposes not all photographs may be of their own making.</p>

					<p><strong>Text Markup Language</strong>, is a markup language for creating web pages, and interpreted by browsers, this technology consists of joining the HyTime and SGML standards. HyTime is a standard used for structured representation of hypermedia and content based on time. SGML is a standard for text formatting, not developed for hypertext, but has become important for turning documents into hyper-objects and for describing links.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> is a mechanism used to format the style of an HTML page. These styles can be added directly into the element, can be added in the header of the html document and identify the HTML elements with specific tags, or else, the most organized way is in own documents .css identify the html elements with the proper tags, and create a link that identifies you in the HTML document header.</p>
					<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is an interpreted front-end programming language, used to perform small client-side scripts, without the need to access the server. It is fairly used to work with the HTML page design and some iterations. Currently it is being used as a server language as is the case of the node.js, angula.js and others frameworks. It is a language based on ECMAScript and standardized by Ecma international in the specifications ECMA-262 and ISSO / IEC 16262.</p>

			<p><strong>Bootstrap</strong> is a framework for developing interface and front-end components for websites and web applications. Uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript based on design templates for typography and enhancing the user experience.
				With the emergence of such frameworks, designs began to think of their sites with the mobile-first methodology. </p>

			<p><strong>JQuery</strong> is a JavaScript function library used to interact with HTML, used in more than 70% of the most visited sites in the world and is the most popular JavaScript library. It is designed to make it easier to navigate the HTML document, from selecting DOM elements, creating animations, manipulating events, and developing AJAX applications. These facilities allow programmers to create layers of abstraction for low-level interactions in a simplified way in dynamic web applications of great complexity.</p>
			<p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</strong> is the methodological use of technologies like JavaScript and XML, to make web pages more iterative with the user, with the use of asynchronous requests of information. Multiple requests can be made to the server, and the site does not stop waiting for the responses. The answers obtained can be both XML and JSON, the latter has been more used in recent times, and for transferring information that is not standardized. XMLHttpRequest has an important role in ajax web development technique to communicate with server-side scripts.</p>
			<p><strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong> is an open, compact, open standard format for simple and fast interchange of data between systems. It is a model of information transmission in text format, much used in web services that uses representational state transfer (REST) and AJAX applications.</p>
			<p><strong>Hypertext Preprocessor</strong> is a general purpose open source scripting language, but more used for web development and can be embedded in HTML.
				What distinguishes PHP from JavaScript is that the code runs on the server side and the client only sees HTML, which is good for hiding more specific business rules.</p>
